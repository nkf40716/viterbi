Viterbi algorithm - A dynamic programming algorithm for seaching the most likely path in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

There are two algorithms included:

Viterbi algorithm, funtion name - Viterbi_Detector

Edit distance, functon name - Edit_distance

Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two strings. 

Three types of difference between two strings is defined: Insertion, Deletion, Substitution.
